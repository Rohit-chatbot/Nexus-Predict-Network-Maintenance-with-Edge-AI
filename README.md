#  Nexus Predict : Network Maintenance with Edge AI
Welcome to the  Nexus Predict : Network Maintenance with Edge AI

## Overview
The  Nexus Predict : Network Maintenance with Edge AIsystem includes the following features:

~ Network Anomaly Detection: The system can detect network anomalies and performance degradation in real-time by analyzing network data, such as traffic patterns, signal strength, and congestion.

~ Predictive Network Planning: The system can predict network traffic and plan network resources allocation accordingly to ensure optimal performance.

~ Dynamic Network Optimization: The system can dynamically optimize network resources allocation based on real-time network conditions, such as traffic load, weather conditions, and network congestion.

~ Energy Efficiency Optimization: The system can optimize the energy consumption of the network by dynamically adjusting network resources allocation based on the energy efficiency of different network components.

To implement this project, we used various AI technologies, such as supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms, deep learning, reinforcement learning, and natural language processing. We also integrated the AI-powered optimization system with Open RAN interfaces, such as O-RAN, to enable seamless integration and interoperability.
